# FuzeFront app self-registration — run as a Kubernetes INIT CONTAINER.
#
# Registers the app with the FuzeFront platform at pod startup: app registry entry,
# AuthZ (Permit) policy, and billing profile. Idempotent — safe to run on every pod
# start, every restart, and concurrently across replicas.
#
# WHY THIS IS AN INIT CONTAINER AND NOT A BEST-EFFORT SIDECAR:
# the app depends on FuzeFront for AuthN, AuthZ, org/user context, and billing. An
# unregistered app cannot function correctly, so a registration failure MUST stop the
# pod — it exits non-zero and the pod CrashLoopBackOffs until the problem is fixed.
# Failing loudly at deploy beats a half-registered app serving traffic.
#
# Required env:
#   FUZEFRONT_API_URL             base URL, e.g. http://fuzefront-applications:3003
#   FUZEFRONT_REGISTRATION_TOKEN  bearer token for a service account with apps:register
# Optional env:
#   REGISTRATION_DIR   directory holding manifest.json (default: /registration)
#   SKIP_ACTIVATE      "true" to register but not activate (staged rollout)
#
# Exit codes: 0 = registered/activated (or already was). 1 = anything else.

# CrashLoopBackOff'd with a failure that looks identical to a bad token — the same
# pod state, a completely different cause. FuzeMarket, the one product whose
# registration actually works in prod, has always parsed with grep/sed for exactly
